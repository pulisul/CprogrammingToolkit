/*In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, 
Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by 
a letter some fixed number (third parameter) of forward positions the alphabet.Second parameter is array size and first parameter is string
